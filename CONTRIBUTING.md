# Playing & Modding

## 🧠 Strategy for "The Sentient" Update
The AI is now allowed to **invent rules**.
* If the Loom says: *"Gravity is heavy here. Use fewer than 5 words,"* **OBEY IT.**
* If the Loom says: *"Draw me a sheep in Python,"* **WRITE THE CODE.**

## 🧬 Reporting Creative Mutations
Because the AI has "Creative License," it might invent a game mechanic we never thought of.
* Did it force you to speak in binary?
* Did it render a map of the "Dream World" using ASCII?
**Report these mutations in the Issues tab!** We want to see what the Sentient Loom creates.
