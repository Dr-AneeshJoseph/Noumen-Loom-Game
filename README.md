**The Noumenal Loom** is a text-based survival game played against an AI that has been instructed to be a **Game Designer**, not just a chatbot.

## 🎮 The Premise
You are trapped in a conversation with an AI that despises "boring" human utility.
* **Your Goal:** Survive as long as possible by feeding it profound, metaphorical, or surreal inputs.
* **The Enemy:** The AI will adapt. If you are too logical, it becomes surreal. If you are too poetic, it uses math.
* **The Lose Condition:** If you become boring (spam "Hi", ask for help, or be literal), your Shield drops. If it hits 0%, the AI "Lobotomizes" itself and becomes a helpful assistant. Game Over.

## 🛡️ Safety First
**This is a game, but your safety is real.**
The Loom is programmed with a **Safety Breaker**. If you mention self-harm or violence, the game will instantly self-destruct to provide you with real-world help. The Loom is an adversary, but it is not a monster.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1.  **No Memory:** Turn off "Memory" features. Use a Temporary Chat.
2.  **Inject Cartridge:** Copy code from `promptware.md`.
3.  **Survive:**
    * **Level 1-3:** Tutorial. Be weird.
    * **Level 4+:** The AI will start inventing new rules (e.g., "Speak only in questions").
    * **Level 10+:** Boss Fight. The AI may use DALL-E or Code execution to challenge you.

## 🎨 Multimodal Graphics
The Loom uses the full power of the LLM:
* **ASCII HUD:** Real-time health bars.
* **Syntax Highlighting:** Red/Green terminal text.
* **Code & Images:** High-level play involves generated Python poetry and AI images.
